# My Veewee

This is my fork of the Veewee project where I will try to clear out the existing elaborate configuration they have done
and provide clean VMs that look more like the default OS installations.

The only configuration I will keep is that which is only relevant to a virtual machine like the VBox additions and
Vagrant support.

Current available "clean" VMs:

* [templates/Debian-7.1.0-amd64-netboot-clean](templates/Debian-7.1.0-amd64-netboot-clean)
* [templates/Debian-7.4.0-amd64-netboot-clean](templates/Debian-7.4.0-amd64-netboot-clean)
